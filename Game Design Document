Section 1: Game Overview
    Purpose:
        This game is intended to be a fun platformer with some exploration and story elements. While some skill will be needed, the game should leave the player with a more cozy feeling.

    Target audience:
        The target audience is adults 25-60 years old. They may have grown up with video games from the 80s, 90s, and 00s, and the pixel art style will connect with them via nostalgia for those classic platformers, but that don't require the seemingly unending time they had when they were kids.

    Genres:
        Main genre: platformer
        Sub genres: exploration; narrative

Section 2: Gameplay
    Objective/Goal:
        The main goal of this game is to rescue your people from the monsters that took them. Each level will have an end goal to reach through platforming and avoiding obstacles.

    Game Progression and Play Flow:
        Players will control the character through a platforming level with a end goal to reach (similar to the flag pole in SMB). Levels should build in difficulty until the end.

    Challenge:
        Challenge in this game will mainly come through platforming mechanics -- jumping and running through the level, avoiding obstacles
