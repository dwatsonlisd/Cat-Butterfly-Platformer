In a small house in a quiet village, there lived a couple and their four cats. One day, a mysterious wizard came to town selling magic trinkets that promised to make life easier for people in a number of ways. The husband bought one of these trinkets, hoping it would help ease his and his wife's burdens. Unbeknownst to them, however, the triket was a trap, and when they went to use it to clean the dishes, a portal opened up and they were whisked away. The four cats, finding their people stolen away, gathered together and vowed to rescue their people from whatever fate the wizard has in store for them.
