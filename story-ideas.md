# Story Ideas

In a small house in a quiet village, there lived a couple and their four cats. One day, a mysterious wizard came to town selling magic trinkets that promised to make life easier for people in a number of ways. The husband bought one of these trinkets, hoping it would help ease his and his wife's burdens. Unbeknownst to them, however, the triket was a trap, and when they went to use it to clean the dishes, a portal opened up and they were whisked away. The four cats, finding their people stolen away, gathered together and vowed to rescue their people from whatever fate the wizard has in store for them.

Backstory - I want this to be based on real life but with a layer of fantasy on it to add some distance.

In a small house in a quiet village, there lived a couple and their four cats. Years ago, the couple had three daughters, but a sickness had swept through the land and taken their daughters from them.

    (I'm not sure if the player will ever completely know this, but the three daughters will be represented by the three butterflies. I probably won't include names, but it's possible I'll change my mind later.)

    (It is in this context that the bit with the wizard happens. Although their lives are happy with their cats, there is a sadness in the background; I'm not sure yet how I will depict this, but it will need to be subtle.)

    (I want the wizard's trinkets to be somewhat basic. I also am wondering about gameplay; could do something similar to Zelda 2 with an overworld and more specific platforming levels, and I might start with the husband's POV and have the player play them first. That may end up being more complicated, but at the same time, the two sections don't have to be in active development at the same time (and realistically can't be); rather, it's more of a story-telling thing. I think the top-down overworld part would be more story-based anyway and fairly limited; it needn't be a focus for a while.)
