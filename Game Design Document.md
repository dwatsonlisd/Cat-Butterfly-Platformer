Section 1: Game Overview
    Purpose:
        This game is intended to be a fun platformer with some exploration and story elements. While some skill will be needed, the game should leave the player with a more cozy feeling.

    Target audience:
        The target audience is adults 25-60 years old. They may have grown up with video games from the 80s, 90s, and 00s, and the pixel art style will connect with them via nostalgia for those classic platformers, but that don't require the seemingly unending time they had when they were kids.

    Genres:
        Main genre: platformer
        Sub genres: exploration; narrative

Section 2: Gameplay
    Objective/Goal:
        The main goal of this game is to rescue your people from the monsters that took them. Each level will have an end goal to reach through platforming and avoiding obstacles.

    Game Progression and Play Flow:
        Players will control the character through a platforming level with a end goal to reach (similar to the flag pole in SMB). Levels should build in difficulty until the end.

    Challenge:
        Challenge in this game will mainly come through platforming mechanics -- jumping and running through the level, avoiding obstacles and defeating enemies.
        
Section 3: Mechanics
    Rules:
        Will the player have lives or a life-bar? For cats, the normal way would be to do some variation of 9 lives, but I think for this game I don't want to do that extreme a thing; maybe more of a "you need to restart a level or section but no permanent death."
        What happens when they fall off of a platform? Are there endless abysses, or does every level have a bottom to which the player falls?
        What direction do the levels go? Up? Right? some combination?
    Model of the Universe:
        I imagine the physics of the world being similar to other platformers with exaggerated physics -- ability to jump higher than normal, climb up the sides of walls, double-jump, etc.
    Character Actions:
        Movement:
            walk and run -- I imagine there being a difference between walking and running, apart from speed
                - The first difference would be the ability to stop; walking should allow the player to stop faster, whereas running would carry momentum and reuqire more distance to stop.
                - The second difference would be the effect on jumping -- running should allow the player to jump farther than walking.
                - I'm not sure about this part, but I imagine that walking and running might also affect how different enemies respond
